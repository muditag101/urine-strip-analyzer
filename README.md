# Urine Strip Analyzer

This project is a web application that allows users to upload an image of their urine strip, analyzes the image, and returns the RGB values of the 10 color patches on the strip. The backend is built with Django, and the frontend is created with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Image processing is done using OpenCV.
